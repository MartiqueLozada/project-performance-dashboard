# 📊 Project Performance Dashboard

This project simulates a realistic project management environment and demonstrates how SQL can be used to extract actionable insights from operational data. It covers key metrics such as task progress, budget adherence, employee utilization, and risk analysis. Visualizations will be developed in Power BI (coming soon).

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- `/datasets/` – Synthetic project management datasets (Projects, Tasks, Resources, Financials, Risks)
- `/results/` – Outputs of SQL queries used for visualization and reporting (e.g., KPIs, risk summaries)
- `project_analysis.sql` – SQL script used to perform comprehensive data analysis across all tables

---

## 🔍 Key Analyses Performed

- ✅ Project Completion Tracking (task-level progress by project)
- 💸 Budget vs. Actual Spend Variance
- 👤 Employee Workload & Utilization Analysis
- ⚠️ Risk Severity & Frequency Summary
- ⏳ Task Delay Identification & Bottleneck Analysis

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **SQL (MySQL)** – for querying, aggregating, and analyzing data
- **Excel** – for initial dataset preparation & formatting
- **Power BI** – for interactive data visualization (in progress)

---

## 📊 Visual Dashboards (Coming Soon)

The upcoming Power BI dashboard will include:
- 📌 KPI Summary Cards
- 📈 Budget & Resource Allocation Charts
- 🗓 Gantt Timeline for Projects
- 🔥 Risk Heatmaps
- 📊 Task Completion by Project

## 🎯 Project Purpose & Learning Highlights

This project was a way to deepen my SQL skills and apply them in a realistic, project management context. Along the way, I focused on:

- Writing efficient SQL queries with joins, aggregation, and date logic  
- Analyzing performance metrics like budget variance and team utilization  
- Structuring data for clear insights and future visualization in Power BI  
- Simulating real-world reporting workflows using multiple connected datasets
